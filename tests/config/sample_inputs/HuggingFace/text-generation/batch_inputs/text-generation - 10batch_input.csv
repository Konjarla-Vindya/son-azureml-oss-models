"where megan was a diminutive 5'3 '' , davis was 6'1 '' and two hundred pounds ."
"mason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician ."
"davis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime-the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital ."
"after that , he had n't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent ."
